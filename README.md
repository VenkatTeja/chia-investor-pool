# Chia Investor Pool
Chia pooling protocol for small farmers whose returns on chia will be pooled and invested in futuristic projects. A lot of retails users might have free disk space on their personal machines. Contributing this disk space to Chia will make the network more secure but it will bring down the profitability from Chia tokens directly.  

The idea is to pool these earnings from small farmers and invest in potential startups. After a few years, the successful startups can pay dividends in Chia or their tokens can be liquidated to Chia by the farmers who want to book profits. 

At this point, the following questions might araise:
1. How the pooling protocol will collect funds?
2. Who would choose which projects or tokens to invest in?
3. How would this affect Chia price?
